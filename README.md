PlaybackNotifier
================

Simple program meant to pull the currently playing media file in either of the iTunes or Spotify applications and post it as a local notification.

Current features:
iTunes and Spotify support

WIP features:
Add support for album artwork so that the graphic will be shown instead of the application icon in the notification alert.
Refactor a few files to reflect support for Spotify and not just iTunes.
Planning to add ability to also show notifications for other applications
    - Rdio's app doesn't have a proper API at time of writing. Might try to find a workaround of some sort.
